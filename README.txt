This repository was created as a test platform to explore the MEAN and MERN dev stack.

Features and/or Assignments:
08/08/2019 - Initialized activity by building a Node server with EXPRESS 
08/09/2019 - Built basic front-end and back-end for navigation
08/10/2019 - Explored funtionality of the javaScipt library Socket.io by impleting form submission
08/11/2019 - Implemented Socket.io to simulate users entering chat room visible by all connected clients
8/12/2019 - Completed chat room with web sockets, small bugs with leaving chat room. However since implementation excluded the use of a DB, I decided to end dev at this point. Will revisit application once I finish MongoDB and will potentially implement with rardin messaging application.
